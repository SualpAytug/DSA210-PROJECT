# Caffeine, Sleep and Productivity
## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze how my daily sleep patterns and caffeine consumption affect my productivity. Over the next one month, I plan to systematically track my daily sleep patterns (including duration and quality), caffeine intake, and productivity throughout the day. Productivity will be measured based on the amount of time I spend studying or completing various kinds of tasks and activities, as well as my motivation to carry them out. By collecting and analyzing these data, I hope to gain insights into how my productivity is affected by my sleep quality and caffeine consumption.


## Motivation 
As a university student, productivity plays a crucial role in my life, both for achieving academic success and for my overall self-improvement. I often consume caffeinated drinks such as coffee, especially during stressful and busy periods like exam weeks, believing that they may help me to remain productive. In addition to caffeine, I generally try to sleep well, but sometimes I sacrifice my sleep in order to study before exams or to do homework. Through this project, I aim to better understand how caffeine consumption and sleep patterns may affect my productivity, so that I can make informed changes in my life to improve my productivity and efficiency. 


## Dataset and Sources
The dataset of this project consists of several factors mentioned below.
- **Caffeine consumption:** Daily intake will be recorded in a Google Sheets file.
- **Sleep duration and quality:** Daily sleep patterns will be collected from Apple Watch's "Sleep" app.
- **Productivity level:** Daily productivity will be recorded manually via self-reports in a Google Sheets file. 

## Data Analysis
1. Data will be collected consistently over the next one month.
2. At the end of the data collection process, the dataset will be examined for accuracy and completeness, and will be reorganized if necessary.
3. After data preprocessing, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** will be performed to identify patterns, trends and correlations through statistical and visualization techniques.

## Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (**H₀**): There is no significant relationship between my productivity and my daily caffeine consumption or sleep pattern.              
Alternative Hypothesis (**Hₐ**): There is a significant relationship between my productivity and my daily caffeine consumption or sleep pattern. 


## Tools
- **Python** will be used for data preprocessing, organization, manipulation, visualization and correlational analysis.
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
  - Numpy
- **Apple Watch Sleep app** will be used to record sleep pattern.
- **Google Sheets** will be used to record and combine data.


## Limitations
- The data that will be collected and used to test hypotheses will be my individual data. A person's productivity and the possible effects of caffeine consumption or sleep pattern may vary from person to person; therefore the findings of this project are not generalizable.
- The dataset is limited to observations over a one month period. The long term effects of these factors on productivity may vary.
