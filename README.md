# Caffeine, Sleep and Productivity
## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze how my daily sleep patterns and caffeine consumption affect my productivity. Over the next few months, I plan to systematically track my daily sleep patterns (including duration and quality), caffeine intake, and productivity throughout the day. Productivity will be measured based on the amount of time I spend studying or completing various kinds of tasks and activities, as well as my motivation to carry them out. By collecting and analyzing these data, I hope to gain insights into how my productivity is affected by my sleep quality and caffeine consumption.

## Motivation 
As a university student, productivity plays a crucial role in my life, both for achieving academic success and for my overall self-improvement. I often consume caffeinated drinks such as coffee, especially during stressful and busy periods like exam weeks, to stay productive. I also try to sleep well generally, but sometimes I sacrifice my sleep in order to study before exams. Through this project, I aim to better understand how caffeine consumption and sleep patterns may affect my productivity, so that I can make informed changes in my life to improve my productivity and efficiency. 

## Data Collection & Analysis



## Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (**H₀**): There is no significant relationship between my daily caffeine consumption and tendency to procrastinate.                 
Alternative Hypothesis (**Hₐ**): There is a significant relationship between my daily caffeine consumption and tendency to procrastinate.

## Tools
- **Python**
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
  - numpy

## Limitations
- The data that will be collected and used to test hypotheses will be my individual data. A person's tendency to procrastinate and the possible effects of caffeine consumption may vary from person to person; therefore the findings of this project are not generalizable.
