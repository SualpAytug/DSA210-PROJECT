# Procrastination and Caffeine
## Project Overview


## Motivation 

## Data Collection & Analysis


## Plan


## Hypothesis Testing
Null Hypothesis (**H₀**): There is a significant relationship between my daily caffeine consumption and tendency to procrastinate.          
Alternative Hypothesis (**Hₐ**): There is no significant relationship between my daily caffeine consumption and tendency to procrastinate.

## Tools
- **Python**
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
  - numpy

## Limitations
- The data that will be collected and used to test hypotheses will be my individual data. A person's tendency to procrastinate and the possible effects of caffeine consumption may vary from person to person; therefore the findings of this project are not generalizable.
